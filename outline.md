## Growing an Inner Source Program

25 min

## Audience

This presentation will be given at [OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/71280).
It is intended for those that are evangelizing inner source internally for their specific company.

## Short Description

"Inner source is a great idea! Go do inner source!"
You're the dedicated champion for inner source in your company.
What do you do now?
How do you realistically affect the behavior of dozens or hundreds of teams to the point where robust and pervasive inner sourcing is a normal part of the way that engineering is done?

This presentation shares principles, practical anecdotes, and relatable examples on this situation gleaned from experience at Nike.
While not claiming all of the answers, it summarizes the learnings of over a year of work in the area.

## Detailed description

#### Outline

A successful inner source program needs real amounts of care and feeding to be effective.
Robust and pervasive participation in inner source requires a change in corporate culture.

Documented patterns in this area (well-summarized in [the Fearless Change series](http://www.fearlesschangepatterns.com/)) apply and work.

There are a few patterns that we've been using that are not specific to inner source nonetheless don't appear to have a clear entry in _Fearless Change_.  These are:

* **Opt In**.
_Increase the spread of the new idea by making it more desirable and useful for people to voluntarily opt in to its usage_. 
* **Grass Roots**.
_Visibility and support for the new idea should only be pushed in the management hierarchy as high as there is already a matching breadth of support_.

We'll explaining these principles with clear words and real anecdotes, and end with a call to work together on this shared problem via the InnerSource Commons.

#### Takeaways

After attending this presentation, we hope that viewers will:

* Approach the roll out of an inner source program as a culture change initiative.
* Embrace the principles of opt-in and grass roots
* Be excited to work together on their inner source program via the ISC.
