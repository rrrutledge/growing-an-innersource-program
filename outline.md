## Growing an Inner Source Program

25 min

## Audience

This presentation will be given at [OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/71280).
It is intended for those that are evangelizing inner source internally for their specific company.

## Short Description

"Inner source is a great idea! Go do inner source!"
You're the dedicated champion for inner source in your company.
What do you do now?
How do you realistically affect the behavior of dozens or hundreds of teams to the point where robust and pervasive inner sourcing is a normal part of the way that engineering is done?

This presentation shares principles, practical anecdotes, and relatable examples on this situation gleaned from experience at Nike.
While not claiming all of the answers, it summarizes the learnings of over a year of work in the area.

## Detailed description

#### Outline

Participation in inner source requires real amounts of care and feeding to be effective.
An inner source program is the set of tools, documentation, and training provided so that any team can participate in inner source effectively.

When building an inner source program you should have a vision of what you will provide to facilitate inner sourcing _as well as_ a strategy you will employ to roll out and make effective these services in your organization.
We'll explain principles, resources, and specific examples that can aid and guide in doing so.

The services of the inner source program should provide two things.
First, they must teach, define, and document the type of culture that is conducive to inner source.
Second, there must be software that reinforces that culture while simultaneously lowering the barrier to entry to participating in that culture.

The rollout of an inner source program is similar to the rollout of any large, grass-roots initiative.
You can start the initiative with _any_ of the aforementioned services and add more services to it as needed over time.
Documented patterns in this area (well-summarized in [the Fearless Change series](http://www.fearlesschangepatterns.com/)) apply and work.

There are a few patterns that we've been using that are not specific to inner source nonetheless don't appear to have a clear entry in _Fearless Change_.  These are:

* **Opt In**.
_Increase the spread of the new idea by making it more desirable and useful for people to voluntarily opt in to its usage_. 
* **Grass Roots**.
_Visibility and support for the new idea should only be pushed in the management hierarchy as high as there is already a matching breadth of support_.

After explaining these principles with clear words and real anecdotes, we'll summarize the current state of our inner source program, where we're hoping it will go, and how we aim to get there. We'll express our hope to learn from and work with everyone present via open dialogue and sharing in the inner source commons.

#### Takeaways

After attending this presentation, we hope that viewers will:

* Gain ideas on how to roll out an inner source program.
* Understand the suggested purposes and principles of an inner source program.
* Understand the suggested component parts of an inner source program and their principles.
* Be excited to work together on their inner source program via the ISC.
