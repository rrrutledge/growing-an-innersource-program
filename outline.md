## Growing an Inner Source Program

45 min

## Audience

This presentation will be given at [the ISC Spring Summit](http://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/events/isc-spring-2018-agenda/).
It is intended for those that are evangelizing inner source internally for their specific company.

## Short Description

"Inner source is a great idea! Go do inner source!"
You're the dedicated champion for inner source in your company.
What do you do now?
How do you realistically affect the behavior of dozens or hundreds of teams to the point where robust and pervasive inner sourcing is a normal part of the way that engineering is done?

This presentation shares principles, practical anecdotes, and relatable examples on this situation gleaned from experience at Nike.
While not claiming all of the answers, it summarizes the learnings of over a year of work in the area.

## Detailed description

#### Outline

Participation in inner source requires real amounts of care and feeding to be effective.
An inner source program is the set of tools, documentation, and training provided so that any team can participate in inner source effectively.
To frame the talk, we'll explain the goals of an inner source program as well as the context within-which we've begun to pursue those goals.
Even though the learning in this presentation is occurring in that context, we suspect that much of what's here applies generally.

When building an inner source program you should have a vision of what you will provide to facilitate inner sourcing _as well as_ a strategy you will employ to roll out and make effective these services in your organization.
We'll explain principles, resources, and specific examples that can aid and guide in doing so.

The services of the inner source program should provide two things.
First, they must teach, define, and document the type of culture that is conducive to inner source.
Second, there must be software that reinforces that culture while simultaneously lowering the barrier to entry to participating in that culture.
Examples of these services include:

* Documentation on how to do inner source (and relation of that documentation to [InnerSourcePatterns](http://innersourcecommons.org/patterns)).
* Software for automated, two-way discovery of inner source projects (maintainer to contributor/user and contributor/user to maintainer).
* Software for a data-driven understanding of the impact of inner source projects.
* Software/convention to facilitate individuals communicating with one another.
* Curated training on the above software and documentation.

The rollout of an inner source program is similar to the rollout of any large, grass-roots initiative.
You can start the initiative with _any_ of the aforementioned services and add more services to it as needed over time.
Documented patterns in this area (well-summarized in [the Fearless Change series](http://www.fearlesschangepatterns.com/)) apply and work.
We'll review real examples of how these patterns played out in our journey.
We've used many others from the book, but some of the more-notable include:

* **Personal Touch**.
_To convince people of the value in a new idea, show how it can be personally useful and valuable to them_.
* **Tailor Made**.
_To convince people in the organization of the value they can gain from the new idea, tailor your message to the needs of the organization_.
* **Smell of Success**.
_When your efforts result in some visible positive result, people will come out of the woodwork to talk to you.
Treat this opportunity as a teaching moment_.
* **Sustained Momentum**.
_Take a pro-active approach to the ongoing work of sustaining the interest in the new idea in your organization_.
* **Step by Step**.
_Relieve your frustration at the enormous task of changing an organization by taking one small step at a time toward your goal_.
* **Just Enough**.
_To ease learners into the more difficult concepts of a new idea, give a brief introduction and then make more information available when they are ready_.
* **Test the Waters**.
_When a new opportunity presents itself, see if there is any interest by using some of the patterns in this language and then evaluating the result_.
* **Involve Everyone**.
_For a new idea to be successful across an organization, everyone should have an opportunity to support the innocation and make his own unique contribution_.

There are a few patterns that we've been using that are not specific to inner source nonetheless don't appear to have a clear entry in _Fearless Change_.  These are:

* **Opt In**.
_Increase the spread of the new idea by making it more desirable and useful for people to voluntarily opt in to its usage_. 
* **Grass Roots**.
_Visibility and support for the new idea should only be pushed in the management hierarchy as high as there is already a matching breadth of support_.

We'll also share a few patterns unique to inner source rollout including:

* Run your inner source program as inner source projects.
* Do (or say) nothing save it is documented.
* Program growth/maturity progression starts with facilitating any synchronous, in-person, side-project talking collaboration then grows to facilitating asynchronous, main-project coding collaboration.

After explaining these principles with clear words and real anecdotes, we'll summarize the current state of our inner source program, where we're hoping it will go, and how we aim to get there. We'll express our hope to learn from and work with everyone present via open dialogue and sharing in the inner source commons.

#### Takeaways

After attending this presentation, we hope that viewers will:

* Gain ideas on how to roll out an inner source program.
* Understand the suggested purposes and principles of an inner source program.
* Understand the suggested component parts of an inner source program and their principles.
* Be excited to work together on their inner source program via the ISC.
